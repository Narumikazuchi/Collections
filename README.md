# Description
Initially a project to challenge myself at creating collections which are equally as fast or faster than the ones provided by the .NET Framework, this has now grown into a framework for frequently used, single purpose classes revolving around collections. It contains an implementation for a binary tree, a trie and a few observable collections.
